    <p><h3>Kimchi jigae is a spicy, savory stew comprised of well fermented kimchi, vegetables, sliced tofu, hot pepper flakes, and an anchovy kelp broth. There are 
        many variations of this dish in Korea and all over the world. My favorite consists of the base ingredients with tofu, spam or hotdog, and a scoop of gochujang.
        You can enjoy this popular dish any way you want, with some people adding fish, canned tuna, or even leftover fried chicken!</h3></p>
    <p><h3>Although kimchi jigae is traditionally spicy, you can tailor the spice to your preferred level. The majority of the heat comes from added chilis and the Korean
        red pepper flakes, called "gochugaru." While the pepper is more for color, some variants can pack some heat, so be sure to read the packaging when you buy it. You
        can put any type of vegetables into the stew, as this is a great dish to clean out the fridge. Try squash, broccoli, or even potato to make it more wholesome."</h3></p>

            <li>Sliced Scallions for Garnish</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><h4>Instructions:</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the sesame seed oil to a heated pot. Add onion, garlic, and kimchi, and cook for 4-5 minutes, until fragrant. Stir to ensure even cooking and to
                prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Add in stock or water, kimchi juice, soy sauce and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add gochugaru and gochujang, stirring well to distribute the gochujang throughout the mixture. Once mixed, add dashida, tofu, and spam 
                or hotdog. Mix carefully to avoid breaking up the tofu. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 8-10 minutes or to your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Taste for seasoning. If needed, add salt or pepper, or more dashida if it lacks umami. Top with sliced scallions. Serve with bowls of hot white rice and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

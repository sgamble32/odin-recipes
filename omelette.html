    <p><h3>Omelettes have to be one of the first dishes I learned how to cook when I was younger. My friends would rave about how good my omelettes were and everytime
        they came over omelettes were on the menu. Little did they know my secret - a spice blend my father used to buy that isn't available anymore. That's alright though;
        we can recreate our own spice blend to fit our palette.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>Although there are many different types of omelettes, my favorite has to be the original diner style omelette. Beaten to perfection, fried to a beautiful 
        golden brown in butter, and gooey with cheese, herbs, and bacon. You can substitute anything into these omelettes. Like I said - I love the flexibility of
        these dishes and they can change with just a few substitutions of different ingredients into something entirely different. The sky is the limit. Now let's go!</h3></p>


    <p><h4>Ingredients:</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of Butter</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of Herbes de Provence Spice Blend</li>
        <li>2 Pieces of American Cheese</li>
        <li>Two Pieces of Bacon, Already Cooked</li>
        <li>A Splash of Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Instructions:</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <ls>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk vigorously until smooth. Add a splash of milk into the eggs and beat again.</ls>
        <ls>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Once heated, place the butter into the pan, tilting it to get the butter over the entire surface.</ls>
        <ls>Pour the eggs slowly into the pan, tilting again to cover the entire surface with a thin layer of egg. Once the egg sets slightly, you can 
            pull the edge of the egg inward and allow the liquid egg to enter the gap and cook more evenly.</ls>
        <ls>Once the egg is set, season with salt, pepper, and spice blend to desired level. Place cheese slices in the center, and overlap with bacon pieces.</ls>
        <ls>Once the eggs are cooked to your desired doneness, take a spatula and flip one side of the omelette on top of the other half. Season lightly with salt and pepper.</ls>
        <ls>After about a minute, flip the omelette to the other side and cook for one minute more. Turn off the heat, plate, and garnish with chives. Enjoy!</ls>
    </ol>
